TOP Etch a sketch project


How did we originally get the centered out look? 
body{
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    flex-direction: column;
}
I tried messing around with them individully and interestingly enough, they only give the desired result
while they were working in tandem. Still want to give myself a personal project to really figure out what
all these do individualy and how they react together. For instance display: flex and flex-direction.
